          Introduction : 
             To start with,   I have been fascinated by bridges and architectural buildings from an early age — not only because of their architectural beauty but also because of the complex engineering principles that allow them to stand strong and flexible. When I began studying my  foundation year in civil engineering, I realized how much physics and mathematics contribute to the stability of such structures. This curiosity led me to choose resonance in bridges as the focus of my theoretical research project. Resonance, a phenomenon where an external force causes an object to vibrate at its natural frequency and this has been responsible for both spectacular engineering successes and catastrophic failures. Through this project, my aim was to explore the underlying physics and mathematics of resonance, understand how it affects bridge structures, and learn how engineers design to prevent destructive vibrations. I wanted to connect my childhood admiration for bridges with a deeper technical understanding of why they behave the way they do.
